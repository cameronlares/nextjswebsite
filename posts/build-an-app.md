## How To Develop An App: 5 App Development Best Practices To Follow In 2022

Building an app on your own might have sounded like a pipedream a couple of years ago but so did building your own website. Now, custom web development is a piece of cake with custom web development platforms such as [Velo by Wix](https://www.designrush.com/trends/velo-wix-future-of-web-development). Fast, easy, cutting-edge.

Let's go back to apps. When you factor in the number of users of other mobile devices — such as wearable technology or the over [1 billion](https://www.thinslices.com/blog/smartphone-statistics-tablet-usage-patterns) tablet users globally — the value of a professional [mobile app](https://www.designrush.com/trends/app-development-process) increases exponentially.

But how can businesses learn how to develop an app that suits their business needs without breaking the bank, blowing their budget, or overhauling their entire revenue model?

It turns out that there are several best practices that the best [software development](https://www.designrush.com/agency/software-development/new-york) companies adhere to when creating reliable [mobile apps](https://www.designrush.com/trends/top-most-downloaded-mobile-apps) for clients (such as yourself).

By following these guidelines, developers are able to stretch budgets, keep projects within their projected timelines, and ensure that the finished platform works properly and achieves the desired objective.

Now, it might seem like businesses don’t need to know these best practices — after all, if you aren’t the one who will actually be designing and developing the mobile app, what’s the point?

Well, if you thought that, that’s where you’re wrong. Understanding the process of how to develop an app that mobile app software developers follow throughout each [software development life cycle](https://www.designrush.com/trends/software-development-life-cycle-complete-checklist) — particularly for mobile platforms — is crucial for businesses.

This will empower them to choose the best partner for their company, choose a solution that fits within their budget, and understand more wholly how an app development project is progressing.

And when you understand a project’s ins and outs, you set yourself up for far better success in the long run.
